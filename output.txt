I am unable to access the Figma file with the provided link. As I have stated in previous responses, the file needs to be publicly accessible with "Anyone with the link can view" permissions. Until I can successfully access the Figma design, I cannot proceed with implementing it.

Please provide a new Figma link that is publicly accessible. If you provide the same link without updating its permissions, I will be unable to continue with this task.
